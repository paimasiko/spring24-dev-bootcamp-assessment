        <p>My music taste currently is super broad compared to when I was a kid and only listened to what my parents listened to. 
            My favorite genres right now are Indie Soul, R&B, Alt Rock, Alt Hip-Hop, Metal, J-Pop, and Jazz. I plan to further diversify 
            my music taste this year and discover 100 new artists. Music is a huge part of life and I love it when I find new artists to enjoy. 
            I get so inspired from hearing them talk about what they are doing to give back to their community 
            or their creative process. Tim Henson (the person in the photo above) is a recent example of this for me personally.</p>
