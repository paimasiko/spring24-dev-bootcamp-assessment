            <p>Hi, my name is Peter Aimasiko, I’m a second-year computer science major. 
                This is the front page for my application for the BOG developer bootcamp.The passion, hobbies, and music buttons 
                will take you to separate pages where I talk about the things, I’m passionate about, my current hobbies, 
                and music taste respectively. There is a dark and light mode toggle button below the menu buttons. Finally, 
                there is a secret draggable textbox above this paragraph and when the word "guitar" is typed into it, something special may happen :O</p>
