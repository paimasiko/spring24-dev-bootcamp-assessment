            <p>Hi, my name is Peter Aimasiko, I’m a second-year computer science major. 
                This is the front page for my application for the BOG developer bootcamp. 
                Each of the buttons take you to different pages of the website. The passion, hobbies, and music buttons 
                will take you to separate pages where I talk about the things, I’m passionate about, my current hobbies, 
                and music taste respectively. There is dark and light mode toggle button below the menu buttons. Finally, 
                there is a secret draggable textbox above this paragraph and when the word "guitar" is typed into it, something special may happen :O</p>
        </div>
