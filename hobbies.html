        <p>Some of my current hobbies have been playing the guitar, producing music, and working on 3D modeling. 
            I received the guitar as a gift from my church last year in December and I want to become good enough to play it live for people. 
            I’ve been playing for a few weeks now and I already feel like I’m improving! 
            I’ve been producing music since 2020 and use it as a stress reliever and a way to get my emotions out in a healthy way. 
            I don’t plan on releasing any of it though. 
            Lately, I’ve been learning how to create 3D models in Blender, specifically poly-modeling and sculpting, for use in personal projects. 
            In a few years, I want to start freelancing and selling my models.</p>
