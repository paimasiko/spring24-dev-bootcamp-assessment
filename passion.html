        <p>My major passion in my life ever since I was little has been my volunteer work for my church, Victory Tabernacle in Austell, Georgia. 
            Specifically, I’m a pianist for the Praise & Worship group and a member of the Youth Fellowship. 
            I play piano at church every Sunday and for events that our church decides to host. 
            Piano is something my parents originally got me into when I was 13 and it was something I wasn’t interested in originally. 
            As I became older however, I started to love doing it because I felt like I was making a positive impact on people’s lives even if it felt small. 
            Our Youth Fellowship is all about uplifting the youth not only in our church but in our community.
            We host youth events at church a few times every year and host one big event annually. 
            Last year, our big event was based in Tennessee, so we had a big road trip together!</p>
